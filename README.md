# RetailSales-Analysis

First project for Introduction to Data Science using Python Pandas
In this analysis we had factors that could affect the amount of weekly sales. The goal was to identify these, and see their effects on the average/ sum of sales. 

## What we found:
- The bigger the store, the higher the sales 
- Christmas has the highest *sum* of sales
- Black Friday has the highest *average* sales
- *Average* weekly sales are lower when the weather is more extreme

## What was used:
All code was written in Python Pandas using matplotlib.pyplot, code for assigning 5 major holidays included
